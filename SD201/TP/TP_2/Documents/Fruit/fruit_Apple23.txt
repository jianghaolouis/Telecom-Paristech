North Korea held an apple sampling meeting in Pyongyang on Friday to judge the apples harvested from farms across the country this year.

A video provided by KCNA for Reuters, which cannot be independently verified, showed the apple sampling meeting being held at Unjong Tea House, where the country's agricultural officials and workers in the fruit industry gathered.

Those who were selected as judges looked through various types of apples on display and tasted the apples to rate them.

The apples from Taedonggang Combined Fruit Farm, Kosan Combined Fruit Farm and fruit farms in Kwail County and Pukchong County were submitted for the sampling meeting to estimate their sweetness, sourness, fragrance and moisture, KCNA said.
