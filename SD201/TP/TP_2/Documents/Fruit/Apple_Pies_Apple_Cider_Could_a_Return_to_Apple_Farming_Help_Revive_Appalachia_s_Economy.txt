Apple Pies, Apple Cider Could a Return to Apple Farming Help Revive Appalachia's EconomyHere in Appalachia, it’s apple season. And that means apple growers are sending this year’s crop to farmers markets and grocery stores. But the majority of the apples grown here get sent to manufacturers to be used in apple sauce and apple juice. By the way, did you know that Golden Delicious Apples originated right here in West Virginia?  In fact, apples are our state fruit.

Apples have been a major agricultural industry for the Mountain State. But according to the Department of Agriculture,  the apple industry has decreased in West Virginia since 2010. In particular the Eastern Panhandle, the land that was used to grow apples is experiencing a real estate boom. So in the last few years more and more farmers have been selling their land and getting out of the farming industry. In honor of apple season, we're going to listen back to an episode that originally aired last September, celebrating Apple-Atcha.  In this episode we talk with Josh Bennett and Will Lewis, founders of Hawk Knob Cider, in Lewisburg West Virginia, about reviving this time-honored drink.
