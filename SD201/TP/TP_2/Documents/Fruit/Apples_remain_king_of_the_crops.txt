Apples remain king of the crops
YAKIMA, Wash. -- The state apple harvest is again underway — including orchards throughout the Yakima Valley — and will continue into next month. Washington is expected to harvest 130.9 million 40-pound boxes of fresh packed apples. That’s well below the 2014 record of 141.9 million boxes, but if the estimate holds, it will still be the third-largest crop ever.

Apples are by far the state’s highest-valued agricultural commodity. The value of apples hit a record $2.4 billion in 2015, the latest year figures were available from the Washington State Department of Agriculture. That’s about 22 percent of the $10.7 billion value for all of the state’s agricultural products.

So sit back, enjoy a bite of your favorite variety and chew (pun intended) on these facts about the Yakima Valley’s star crop.


• So far, about 5.5 percent of this year’s crop has been shipped. Applied to the 130.9 million-box estimate, that equals about 7.2 million boxes. Many apples harvested now will be packed and put into cold storage rooms until they are shipped.

• According to the most recent figures (2012) from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the state had about 174,152 acres of apple orchards. The Washington State Tree Fruit Association is in the process of a new survey that will provide a more updated accounting. The number of acres is expected to increase because more trees have been planted in recent years, but it’s also worth noting that the amount of apples produced by a single tree also has increased. In other words, 10 acres of apple trees planted now likely would produce more apples than the same 10 acres planted 10 years ago.

• Since 2002, the state’s apple crop has been above the 100 million box mark for 11 seasons, including the past nine, according to figures from the tree fruit group. The lowest-yielding crop during the period came in 2003, at 79.9 million boxes.

• It’s no secret that the number of Red Delicious apples, which once made up a supermajority of the state’s crop, has dropped in recent years, but the variety still remains at the top and is expected to make up a quarter of all apples harvested this year. The Gala apple — now at 23 percent — is expected to take the top spot in the years to come. Honeycrisp, a sweeter variety developed by apple breeders at the University of Minnesota in the 1960s, is expected to make up about 7 percent of this year’s crop, double the percentage from five years ago. Rounding out the top varieties are Fuji at 14 percent, Granny Smith at 13 percent and Golden Delicious at 5.9 percent.

• About 30 percent of the statewide fresh apple crop is exported. Mexico is by far the top importer of Washington apples. As of August, 12.7 million boxes of apples from the 2016 crop had been shipped there. After Mexico, other top importing countries are Canada at 5.5 million, India at 4.8 million, Taiwan at 3 million and China at 1.8 million.


• The apple harvest generated about 39,300 direct jobs earlier this decade, according to the Washington Apple Industry Economic Contributions Study from 2012.

Those who work harvesting apples are paid by the amount of fruit they pick, known as a piece-rate. There may be changes to that system pending a decision related to a case before the state Supreme Court. It involves a class-action lawsuit against Dovex Fruit Co. in Wenatchee; the court will decide whether workers should be paid separately for tasks not related to picking, such as moving equipment, training and meetings.

Those advocating for the workers say nonpayment for nonpicking tasks violates minimum wage laws; apple growers argue the piece-rate already pays workers well above minimum wage — upwards of $25 an hour for experienced pickers — and that a piece-rate rather than an hourly wage increases worker productivity. The court heard arguments on the case last month.

• Meanwhile, there are efforts to find a way to mechanize apple picking. A few companies working on robotic pickers are hoping to introduce them to the commercial market by 2019, but many in the industry say widespread use is still years away. In the meantime, apple growers have been working on preparing for the technology by planting more acreage in a trellis style — similar to how wine grapes are planted — rather than the big, tall trees that most associate with apple orchards.
