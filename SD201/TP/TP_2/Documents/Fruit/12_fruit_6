Selection and Storage

Fresh apples can be readily available in the stores all around the season. Choose fresh, bright, firm textured apples with a pleasnt flavor. Avoid fruits with pressure marks over their surface as they indicate underlying mottled pulp.

Fresh apples can be kept at room temperature for few days and stored in the refrigerator for up to two to three weeks. Wash them in clean running cold water before use.


Preparation and Serving Tips

Wash apples thoroughly in the running water to remove any surface dust, insecticide/fungicide sprays. Trim off its top end using a paring knife, and cut the fruit into two halves. Take out tiny, centrally placed, bitter seeds. Slice the fruit into desirable cubes or slices.

Here are some serving tips:

Eat apple fruit "as it is" along with its peel to get maximum health-benefits.

Sliced apple turns brown (enzymatic brownish discoloration) on exposure to air due to conversion in iron form from ferrous oxide to ferric oxide. If you have to serve them sliced, rinse slices in water added with few drops of fresh lemon.

Cloudy as well as clear apple juice is a healthy alternative drink with dinner.

Apple fruit is also used in the preparation of fruit jam, pie, and fruit salads.

Safety profile

Good yield demands close attention and supervision of apple fruit crop. According to the environmental working group reports, the apple fruit is one of the heavily pesticide-contaminated produces. The most common pesticides found in apples are organo-phosphorous and organochloride pesticides like Permethrin and DDT. Therefore, it is recommended to wash the fruit thoroughly before use. If possible, use organically certified apples.
