months later volcano was released first film was smart exhilirating best disaster films i had ever seen latter film was incohesive mess defied logic wasted talent well 's deja vu all over again disaster films go head head competition time unfortunately first comet flick is so bad people may shy armageddon upcoming comet-disaster be released beginning july course general reaction audience was oppposed mine so i am minority i was when i stood side dante peak watching deep impact i began wonder how anyone right mind could actually like film apparently many did utterly baffles be completely honest i have n't had little fun watching disaster film entire life volcano had implausibilities wazoo was still rather fun watch deep impact does n't just have implausibilities also contains cheap human drama incredibly horrible special effects poorly constructed plot only thing gives half star bottom ranking is slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes good actors making most characters deep impact begins unnamed year year varies advanced technology sets future fire sky is showing local movie theater pushing back line students is outside night peering telescopes dark sky are leo biederman elijah wood sarah hotchner leelee sobieski leo unknowingly discovers comet teacher sends photo unknown object astronomer then is able determine correct path distant comet few seconds races mail

question so yada yada reveal comet public plans send massive spacecraft destroy can arrive announce plan called ark is only hope survival computer will select people random people are ones will go large cave underground impact comet wo n't kill entire human race years dust will settle actually would take much much longer approximately years i understand humans could come back surface start rest plot is standard disaster film procedures is subplot mentioning jenny father jason maximilian schell have very touching relationship forms impending doom final moment involving characters is heartfelt emotional 's shame nothing else is heartfelt now course know comet does impact surface title alone suggests previews actually show doing absoltuely tension can be drawn attempt stop comet know wo n't work director mimi leder came successful tries direction episodes hit television show er major film debut was peacemaker pathetic heartless action film well time leder outdid creating film worse suggestion ms leder please stay away big screen least action genre much blame can be placed leder directly pace is disastrously film are given subtitles tell how much time has passed goes months weeks hours literally feels lapsed time is taking place real-time 's boring course leder is n't blame screenwriters michael tolkin bruce joel rubin have crafted simplistic story only gets worse time starts promising soon turns deadly audience anyway chock full cheesy liners know are going have more sex anyone else school stupid characters might think were back again only subplots is remotely interesting rest are forgettable boring main plot is so outrageous ca n't figure film is supposed be action drama sci-fi put simply special effects film are hit miss situation 's right % miss % hit scenes earth are well done orbiting ship is majestic comet is huge mistake making more laughable frightening concept even trying land comet is preposterous enough 's forgiveable is n't forgiveable is actually having humans walk surface give break will ya course much hyped collision comet earth well is far spectacular makes independence day look brilliant water rushing land is effective hits continent effects turn ridiculous cgi water is used looks so bad i heard more laughs audience shrieks fact i may even recommend film want see how bad effects can actually get days just when think visual effects ca n't be improved comes film show really can should be thing has struck wrong note concerning mimi leder direction also influences actors leder loves show actors faces moments terror reminded action director renny harlin die hard cliffhanger harlin succeeds shows faces victims realistic situations leder likes flaunt people fears faces instead coming sympathetic leder seems more sadist moment has astronaut flying space should be enough warrant response audience leder wants go farther shows person face drifting space is cheapest ways ellicit emotional response audience i am not going be fooled note leder film only picks pace last fifteen minutes when comet actually impacts pace does pick very emotional moments are shown then again when watch people cry loved ones 's obvious will be emotional 's mostly just big trick rope viewers feeling characters did n't work anyway actors do as much can are given t leoni bad boys tv naked truth is best film is given meatiest role character is made stronger leoni presence grow care robert duvall is energetic fun watch character is turned shreds plot elijah wood also comes rather successfully still has n't had many good roles wood stick drama are too talented stuff vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable performance is only enhanced strong presence screen maximilian schell is distracting does provide nice humor morgan freeman has been infinitely better gives most shallow performances date is quite remarkable leelee sobieski could have been better i think just suffered poorly written character special note should go ron eldard denise crosby eldard is good role is limited plot crosby is special personally was tasha yar tv star trek next generation seeing was highlights film overall very talented cast virtually wasted deep impact is rated pg-13 disaster related elements brief language is worst films year is omen things come summer could be worst ever luckily x-files movie is coming hopefully armageddon will be more successful 's shame film will do so successfully just is n't worth much costing nearly special effects done illustrious ilm is huge shocker score composed oscar-winner james horner titanic might have

script problems how handle tricky question language book apes had own language human eventually learned language could have been done film would have required entire film be subtitled non-ape-speaking serling avoided having apes speak english course is justification end film justifying why apes spoke english may have even been inspiration surprise ending serling never tackles all-important question why supposedly intelligent human never shows curiosity even surprise apes speak own language language had opportunity ever hear few viewers questioned serious plot hole however film has become well respected cinema history partial credit least should go jerry goldsmith extremely inventive score is goldsmith best not best when film success called sequels filmmakers turned violence added well-intentioned not very subtle political messages was happening united states 1960s first film had little shooting guns was there seemed little half- hearted second film planet apes was good deal more violence point series had lot violence chases series concluded battle planet apes now director tim burton tries hand adapting original book again thought version was not very faithful book burton new version is even less faithful first does not really reverse roles humans apes has be intelligent articulate races battling dominance planet currently hands uh make paws apes could be good story too is not planet apes mission impossible films so many other cinematic homages third quarter last century title makes promises filmmakers have intention honoring leo davidson mark wahlberg not world 's most expressive actor works space station increasing intelligence usefulness apes then convenient time storm sweeps wizard-of-oz-fashion drops alien planet survives storm then storm is perfect quickly finds not greatly surprise shows planet apes rule humans drool everybody talks language talk is earth- english apparently does not even occur leo is mystery needs be explained fact does not occur leo apparently did n't occur tim burton is heart real horror film just assumed apes were going talk language would speak would be english case having talking race dominating makes not look human-animal relationships more master-slave relationships sudan few other countries is less relevant topic leo is captured be used slave also is discovered ari played helena bonham carter ari is attractive ape close ties high political power is bent making world better place perhaps previous draft script was called hil-ari case makeup stifles usual pout carter is just about as attractive has ever been film may want consider become standard look point forward is not long before leo escapes human only couple sympathetic apes is further abandonment source material chase severely limits interplay ape human examination place reversed society important book can not see how society works most screentime society has broken see humans separated apes fighting burton chooses visceral thrills cerebral ones almost turn is miscalculation characters so lacking empathy value are difficult ones place much emotional investment are basically chess pieces viewer has little reason root win script had little subtlety lines i never met ape i did n't like least cared happened taylor main character most film has offer is visuals visual work is spotty generally nicely done so much film takes place night fog tends limit close looks makeup general seems much improved makeup team is led rick baker instead john chambers did version chambers makeup was jaw-dropper was realistic enough almost be believable flexible enough show emotion chambers is good anyone had chance best would have be baker today audiences have higher expectations baker visualization is really improvement visuals work nicely does not work is wire- assisted leaps apes make look were inspired physics- defying leaps crouching tiger hidden dragon apes spring incredible distances best scenes are apes running battle looking have ape posture when start flying air effect is lost final visual problem is film frequently shows budget should be spectacular battle scenes camera shows only small group people close-up days lon chaney boris karloff few actors have crossed stardom role required heavy make-up actor has shot is paul giamatti is not lines are so good most are silly jokes delivers very well was always watchable actor has not yet made stardom ape-trader limbo over-emotes overcome ape make-up does very well doing so makes most interesting thing screen is probably best thing film conjures memories peter ustinov performance spartacus in-joke are several lines script borrowed film old ape played charleton heston becomes allusion first film danny elfman score has nice primitive feel jerry goldsmith tour force score is real classic score whole film will be remembered when film is forgotten i rate remake scale -4 +4 scale \",\n",

theatrical cut film runs minutes shorter lynch originally intended thinking universal oh-so-wise money men was films hours duration were not popular audiences time would not do well box office lynch initial cut running closer more hours studio demanded further cuts be made great idea why not trim already complex film so make almost incomprehensible most glaring consequence one-eyed stupidity is hopelessly jumpy narrative leaving badly underdeveloped characters thus personalities are vague motivations unclear case paul father duke leto demise rather meaningless end result is distinct chill ca n't warm most cast do n't care much hardly helps voice-over narration is sparse dune-esque language terminology sounds so much gobbledegook unfamiliar book dune is also very serous film constant

respects dune certainly confused frustrated lot people release many chose stay away altogether film disastrous box office showing attests extended version however is rather different beast lynch stated intention release own special edition director cut film home video clear indication dissatisfaction version ended up theatres alas failed do so choosing move other projects way then is partly lynch own fault appeared instead was unauthorised extended version put together mca tv special projects airing cable networks usa stung action lynch successfully petitioned director guild take name credits replace allen smithee standard pseudonym directors wish disown own work also had screenwriting credit changed anonymous judas certainly looking results mca handiwork 's least dozen instances sheer technical sloppiness are good enough reasons director object gripes must be considered light improvements extended cut dune offers several crucial areas most changes involve restoration extension cut scenes addition extra narration fill many holes original version storyline paul relationship father associates is more intimate moments humour warmth lacking previously political skulduggery involving emperor spacing guild bene gesserits warring houses is far better explained paul initiation fremen way life arrakis is also fleshed considerably further background new prologue has been added featuring narration painted stills give brief history dune universe piece storytelling then mca tv version dune is clearly superior piece editing however is times surprisingly inept use painted stills new prologue works well enough occasional appearance action begins is inappropriate 's sloppy cutting too few instances shots even appear order use repeated footage fabricate certain scenes eg ships coming going soldiers coming going is times clearly out-of-context is kind thing lynch objected rightly so should also be noted several questionable scenes shots theatrical version were deleted satisfy censorship demands u s television most notable omission is gratuitous piece nonsense lynch was n't even herbert book scene features baron harkonnen killing beautiful young man front slobbering henchmen pulling heart plug surreal disturbing episode 's very lynch-esque adds nothing already know baron is nasty piece work own peculiar flaws then extended version dune is generally superior film up contains minutes restored footage approximately minutes altered fabricated newly created sequences idiosyncratic lynch has sudden change heart alan smithee version remains

problem is script has doing things make sense more later undermines powerful villain byrne out-performs arnold scene have together including aforementioned temptation bit is problematic when causes

still hold pretty darn well i am too young have seen star wars theater original release does n't make less dedicated contrary star wars trilogy empire strikes back particular are items very short list why i love movies when i heard george lucas would be making first trilogy nine-film series i got exited when i first saw screenshots film well year ago i embarked year-long drool anticipation when first previews were released last thanksgiving i was ready see film then was hype insane marketing campaign lucasfilm secretive snobbery picture last weeks picture opened multitudes fans waited theaters stood boiling sun days advance just be first ones theater i was tired hearing i was tired seeing cardboard cut-outs characters whenever i went kfc taco bell i just wanted see movie reader do not misunderstand i did not have anti-hype reaction hype was unavoidable i understand accept hype 's just happens when prequel most widely beloved films time get released minutes phantom menace i knew was problem are jedi knights i asked why are churning stale dialogue machine-gun rapidity why are n't characters being developed adventures why is special effects shot nearly frame entire film were just questions early later i asked where 's magic first films why am i looking watch fifteen minutes end film i was tired maddened depressed george lucas has funneled own wonderful movies pointless mindless summer blockbuster phantom menace is star wars film take title jedi talk force 're left is easily most vacuous special effects movies time 's embarrassment i looked desperately scene character is explored new theme is examined special effects shot is n't used are few 're token attempts fact is george lucas has created is simultaneously abysmally bad excuse movie pretty good showcase digital effects is not i wanted see i did n't want leave phantom menace headache bitter taste mouth i did story centers mostly qui-gon jinn liam neeson looking lost confused apprentice

anakin so jedi knights take boy journeys bad guys are darth maul darth sidious have enough lines register characters is n't anything particularly wrong story when looking synopsis form way lucas has handled however unsatisfactory first do n't learn single thing qui-gon jinn not thing was life film well i imagine did n't have 's why feels plot device probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless role why 's recently retired film i do n't blame honestly obi-wan character i was really looking forward learning more is even less interesting mcgregor has just few lines anyone hoping see engaging young actor great performance is urged look elsewhere men are focus phantom menace lucas has served big emotional void centerpiece movie things start pick when characters reach tatooine young anakin

story starts direction veers then ends being totally incomprehensible first film does n't even bother explain should be very simple plot details how does frankie get stigmata merely touching rosary how come atheist was chosen father andrew mentions only very devout believers have ever received stigmata actually i 'm not sure frankie was posessed supposedly stigmata occurs when is posessed holy spirit film later has being posessed dead priest later evil spirit i think is answer question course is very simple possessing entity scene is determined whichever effects flashy camera work mr wainwright wants use time furthermore ending is ridiculously neat little wrap-up filmmakers compound problem ultimately turning film diatribe catholic church do research gospel st thomas 'll find is not being suppressed church film seems claim is readily available local library 's nothing catholics need worry about though stigmata religion is so off-base ca n't be confused anything remotely resembling real catholic church wanted portray catholic priests mobsters should have gone all-out equipped sharkskin suits tommy guns would have been far more interesting i 'm not catholic fact i don care much catholic church cartoonish misrepresentation film should not be considered realistic means 's rare see film fails many levels stigmata does s not thought-provoking would like be is
